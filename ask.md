- Do we need implement all tasks from previous homeworks (restart, debug, etc.)?
- Is that ok that i use crypto Api and local storage for auth?
- Is only html validation (js password =) enough for this task?
- Can i save dont hash password or if i need to hash it can i use library for that?
- Do we need email field in login form?
- Is that ok that login && email are unique and can not be changed?
- Can i use [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)?
